<h3 align="left"> <font color="green"> South Africa animals:</h1></font><br><p align="left">
South Africa is a prime wildlife destination. All main safari animals are easily seen in certain places. Kruger Park offers excellent general game viewing and the KwaZulu-Natal parks are the best places to see rhino. In Sabi Sand, the main focus is on seeing the big five; it is famous for its habituated leopards. Seeing these normally shy cats is almost guaranteed here. Wildlife is scattered in Kgalagadi, but sightings in this arid environment tend to be exciting. <br>

<p align="left">
North Africa has a plethora of wild animals including the leopard, the dama gazelle and the striped hyena. Whether you go to Morocco, Egypt, Sudan, Tunisia, Libya, Algeria or Western Sahara, you are likely to encounter any of these animals at the local zoo or on a safari. Guide books such as Lonely Planet and the Rough Guide will give you more information on the different kinds of elephants and gazelles. Although the "big seven" African animals--such as the rhino, elephant and lion--tend to congregate in eastern and southern Africa, the impressive animals of the northern part of the continent are worth a visit.<br>Nourth african animals list:<br>
